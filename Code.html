      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>Russia has invaded Ukraine in the biggest state-against-state attack since World War II. Millions of civilians are caught in the middle of an escalating war and humanitarian crisis, and casualties are rising. Your donation to this fund will support Ukrainians in need, with a focus on the most vulnerable, including children.</p>
      <h1>Challenge</h1>
      <p>Full-scale war in Ukraine is having catastrophic consequences. More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion. Millions more are displaced within the country, making this the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe. Eight years of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine had already created a humanitarian crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic is an added challenge for communities where violence and uncertainty takes a heavy toll.</p>
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p>All donations to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund will support humanitarian assistance in impacted communities in Ukraine and surrounding regions where Ukrainian refugees have fled. GreyScale's local partners are bringing relief to terrified and displaced communities, and they need resources to continue their life-saving work.</p>
      <h1>How Your Donation Will Be Used</h1>
      <p>Your donation to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund will provide:<br>
         <br>
         • Shelter, food, and clean water for refugees<br>
         • Health and psychosocial support<br>
         • Access to education and economic assistance<br>
         • And more</p>
      <h1>About GreyScale’s Disaster Response</h1>
      <p>When a disaster strikes, recovery efforts led by people who live and work in affected communities are often overlooked and underfunded. GreyScale is changing this reality. Since 2004, we've been shifting decision-making power to crises-affected communities through trust-based grantmaking and support.<br>
     <br>
We make it easy, quick, and safe to support people on the ground who understand needs in their communities better than anyone else.<br>
     <br>
They were there long before the news cameras arrived, and they’ll be there long after the cameras leave. They know how to make their communities more resilient to future disasters, and they’re already hard at work. GreyScale puts donations and grants directly into their hands. Because the status quo—which gives the vast majority of funding to a few large organizations—doesn’t make sense.</p>
